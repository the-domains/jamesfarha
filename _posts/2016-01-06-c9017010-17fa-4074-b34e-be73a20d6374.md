Getting to grips with the Grid.io

This is my first post on the Grid.io. It's fair to say that I have been excited about the Grid since I first heard about it nearly 18 months ago and so far, it doesn't disappoint. 

The idea of a dynamically changing, automatically customised website that constructs and runs itself is very compelling. I hate fiddling around with Wordpress, not least because I'm not very good at it. 

I'll be posting much more regularly on here from now, but in the meantime, you can register your interest in [thegrid.io][0] by signing up [here][1].

Have a great year.
